In this project i have upgraded a graph class , in that we use this class to :
1) build with it a real graph
2) check if this graph is connected or not 
3) find the min distance from point to other point 
4) can get the path of this Route.
for getting this graph i have build three classes which extend on each other.
First one was the node class which it represent every point on the graph and save the data of it and number(Tag object) , also it save the points(nodes) that connected to him(bridges).
Second class was the Graph class , that with it we can build our graph , you can add node(point) add a bridge and you can remove nodes or bridge.
Finally , i have build the graph algo which it calculate if the graph is connected , the shorted path , and shortest path distance.
you run the project by building some nodes insert them into graph and connect them to each other(by bridges) after that u can run the graph algo..
also we can save the graph or load saved graph.
I've add some tests for the main classes.
